This repository provides the complete pipeline and materials used to build, evaluate, and validate a profile HMM for detecting Kunitz-type domains in protein sequences. The project was developed as the final assessment for the Laboratory of Bioinformatics 1 course at the University of Bologna.

# Project Overview

Profile Hidden Markov Model for the classification of Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains. Includes structural data curation from PDB, MMseqs2 clustering, PDBeFold alignment, HMM construction with HMMER, and rigorous benchmarking on Swiss-Prot datasets. Final project for the Laboratory of Bioinformatics course at the University of Bologna.

# Project Workflow
## 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

● Data was retrieved from RCSB PDB using a custom query:

 ○ Pfam ID: PF00014
 ○ Resolution ≤ 3.5 Å
 ○ Sequence length 40–80 residues

● A custom report was downloaded from the RCSB website, including the following fields:

 ○ Entry ID
 ○ Polymer Entity ID
 ○ Sequence
 ○ Annotation Identifier
 ○ Chain ID
    
● The protein sequences were extracted from the CSV report using scripts/extract_sequence.sh

## 2. Sequence Clustering

● Used MMseqs2 platform (https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/mmseqs2) to cluster the protein chains
● Identity threshold: 95%, coverage: 95%
● Output: clustered sequences for further analysis

## 3. ID Extraction for Structural Search

● Used scripts/extract_pid.sh to format IDs for PDBeFold

## 4. Structural Filtering

● Used scripts/getchain.py to extract/isolate from each PDB file the structure of the desired chain containing the Kunitz domain

    while IFS=':' read -r pdb chain; do
    python getchain.py "$pdb.pdb" "$chain" > "${pdb}_${chain}.pdb" done < pdb_id.rep

    #to clean the list of any hidden characters
    tr -d '\r' < pdp_id.rep > clean_pdp_id.rep'''
